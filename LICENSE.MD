3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which You create or to which You contribute
are governed by the terms of this License, including without limitation Section 2.2 and the
applicable Contributor Agreement. The Source Code version of Covered Code may be

to the XChangeCore Repository and to anyone to whom you made an Executable version
available; and if made available via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, Modifications must
remain available for at least twelve (12) months after the date it initially became available, or at

3.3. Notice Requirements. You must include, with every copy of the Covered Code You
distribute, either a copy of this license or a hypertext link to an exact copy of this license, in a
manner that is reasonably prominent and accessible by the recipient. If you include a hypertext

distribution by you of the Covered Code. You must cause any of Your Modifications to carry
prominent notices stating that You changed the files. You must retain, in the Source Code that
You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices contained within the
Source Code, including the License Block set forth on Exhibit A.

3.4. Intellectual Property Representation and Warranty. Contributor represents and warrants
that, to the best of his knowledge, Contributor's Modifications are Contributor's original
creation(s) and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this License
and the applicable Contribution Agreement.

3.5. Indemnification for Additional Terms. You hereby indemnify the Initial Developer and
every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability terms You offer to any third party with respect
to the Covered Code. You may place additional conditions upon the rights granted in this
License only to the extent required by statute, judicial order, regulation or national security. Any
such additional conditions must be clearly described in the notice provisions discussed in Section
3.3. Any alteration of the terms of this License will apply to all copies of the Covered Code
distributed by you or by any downstream recipients that receive the Covered Code from you.

3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute Covered Code in Executable
form only if all requirements of this Section 3 have been met for that Covered Code, and if You
include a notice stating that the Source Code version of the Covered Code is available under the
terms of this License, including a description of how and where You have fulfilled the
obligations of Section 3. The notice must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
Executable version, related documentation or collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
relating to the Covered Code. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of
your distribution of Covered Code.

3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining Covered Code with other
code not governed by the terms of this License.

attached the notice in Exhibit A and to Modifications.

4. License Versions.

NIHS may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time. Each version
will be identified with the License. You may always continue to use it under the terms of that
version. You may also choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
version of the License published by NIHS. No one other than NIHS has the right to modify the
terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

5. Disclaimer of Warranty.

ORIGINAL CODE AND COVERED CODE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN
"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE CODE IS
FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NONINFRINGING.
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
COVERED CODE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED CODE PROVE DEFECTIVE
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL
PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED CODE IS AUTHORIZED
HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. Termination.

6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the
breach. All sublicenses to the Covered Code which are properly granted shall survive any
termination of this License. Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You initiate litigation by asserting a patent infringement claim (excluding declaratory
judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
against whom You file such action is referred to as "Participant") alleging that: a. such
Participant's Contributor Version directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all
rights granted by such Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
upon 60 days’ notice from Participant terminate prospectively, unless if within 60 days after
receipt of notice You either: (i) agree in writing to pay Participant a mutually agreeable
reasonable royalty for Your past and future use of Modifications made by such Participant, or (ii)
withdraw Your litigation claim with respect to the Contributor version against such Participant.
If within 60 days of notice, a reasonable royalty and payment arrangement are not mutually
agreed upon in writing by the parties or the litigation claim is not withdrawn, the rights granted
by Participant to You under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 automatically terminate at the expiration of
the 60 day notice period specified above.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user license agreements
(excluding distributors and resellers) which have been validly granted by You or any distributor
hereunder prior to termination shall survive termination.

7. Limitation of Liability.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED CODE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO
ANY PERSON FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES
OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS
EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. Waiver of Sovereign Immunity. The U.S. Government, States and Federallyrecognized
Indian Tribes that use or distribute Covered Code hereby waive their sovereign
immunity with respect to enforcement of the provisions of this License.

9. Miscellaneous.

9.1. This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed to the
extent necessary to make it enforceable.

pursuant to a procurement contract with such a state government, this License shall be governed
by the law of such state, excluding its conflict-of-law provisions, and the adjudication of disputes
relating to this License will be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts
located in such state.

by federal law for all purposes, and the adjudication of disputes relating to this License will be
subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the federal courts located in Washington, D.C.

against the drafter shall not apply to this License.

10. Responsibility for Claims. As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each
Contributor is responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License. Nothing herein is intended or shall be deemed to
constitute any admission of liability.

Code as "Multi-Licensed". "Multi-Licensed" means that the Initial Developer permits you to
